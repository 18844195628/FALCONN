# How to Use FALCONN

FALCONN is a header-only library, so compiling with it is pretty much trivial:
just add it to the include path and then simply write *TBD* in your code.
FALCONN depends on
[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), which must also
be in the include path (so that `#include <Eigen/Dense>` would work *TODO: this
needs to be verified*).
